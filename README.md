 # Abstract
 This thesis redirects attention to its utility in financial risk analysis, specifically
 within the U.S. mortgage sector. We introduce a groundbreaking approach to credit
 risk assessment by deploying a deep learning-based survival model known as Weibull
 Time-to-Failure Recurrent Neural Networks (WTTF-RNN).
 The model uniquely leverages Weibull distribution parameters α (Scale) and β
 (Shape) to quantify parameter uncertainty, thereby enriching the analysis with
 additional depth and interpretability. Moving beyond the inherent limitations
 of traditional Probability of Default (PD) models, which predominantly rely on
 Logistic Regression, the WTTF-RNN model adeptly incorporates variables sensitive
 to economic fluctuations.
 We further demonstrate how Survival Analysis, especially the WTTF-RNN model,
 aids in understanding the timing of a counterparty’s default. This insight is facilitated
 by the survival probability curve, offering invaluable perspectives on not only credit
 loss but also the profitability of a loan portfolio.
 Utilizing Two-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using an experimental block
 design, the model accomplishes dual objectives: it fine-tunes both the feature set and
 model parameters to optimize predictive accuracy. This study represents the first
 effort to employ the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using a Two-Way Block design
 for selecting the best feature set and model while considering parameter uncertainty.
 Even within the constraints of a limited dataset, our preliminary findings confirm the
 WTTF-RNN model’s advantage in this aspect, outperforming conventional methods.
 Lastly, we employ classical model validation techniques and visualize individual
 customer predictions in different ways, generated by our WTTF-RNN model, thereby
 providing a clearer understanding of its performance. This study not only sets a new
 benchmark in credit risk assessment but also opens avenues for future research and
 real-world applications.
